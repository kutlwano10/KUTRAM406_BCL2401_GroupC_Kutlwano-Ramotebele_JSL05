# Galaxy Playlist Generator

## Objective:
To assist us in learning about map(), filter(), and also how to utilize a forEach Loop. These are crucial concepts when delving into programming. This project teaches how to implement these methods or functions to iterate over an array, then generate a new array from the ones iterated with the updated values.

## challenges:
I struggled with implementing these functions, despite being well aware and knowledgeable about their meanings and functionalities. I encountered numerous errors while attempting to execute the code.

## Solutions:
I actively sought out resources to understand their usage, just as I did in similar challenges. I meticulously researched how to iterate over an array containing objects and how to display my modifications on the DOM. Eventually, I grasped how to employ these methods effectively, even in diverse scenarios.

## ImprovementS:

The most important thing is the syntax, i will try by all means to understand the syntax way more better by practicing this functions alot more. I figured out that i need to use them more so that i can understand them. I will make some challenges that are based on this 3 methods , i will also document my understand and try to make everything seem simple for me.
